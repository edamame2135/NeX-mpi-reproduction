## Introduction
We will explore NeX, a new method of novel view synthesis that uses enhanced multiplane image (MPI) techniques to produce view-dependent effects in real-time.

## Technical Details
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;NeX aims to improve upon a previous approach to view synthesis called multiplane image (MPI). MPI uses deep neural networks to extrapolate new views with just two stereo input images. The network takes in as input the two input images as well as camera parameters and infers a global scene representation. The scene is represented as a set of planes, each of which represents an RGB color image and $$\alpha$$/transparency map at a certain depth. In each layer the $$\alpha$$ map is used to occlude certain pixels based on the depth. Then, these planes can then be used to synthesize novel views using homography and composition functions.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While MPI is a more effective solution to view synthesis than previous methods, it still had some issues. Namely, the RGB$$\alpha$$ representation works best on diffuse surfaces and struggles to capture view dependent effects like reflections and specular highlights. MPI and similar methods also suffer from expensive inference which prohibit real-time rendering.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;NeX solves this problem by parameterizing each color value in the MPI as a function of the viewing angle instead of storing color as a static value. This function is approximated as a linear combination of learnable spherical basis functions: $$ C^p(v) = k^p_0 + \sum_{n=1}^{N}k^p_nH_n(v) $$ where $$k^p_n$$ for pixel $$p$$ is the RGB coefficient/reflectence parameters for the $$N$$ basis functions denoted by $$H_n(v)$$. Two separate Multilayer perceptrons (MLPs) are used to optimize the parameters and basis functions.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first MLP predicts per-pixel parameters given the pixel location:
$$
F_\theta : (x) \rightarrow (\alpha,k_1,k_2,...,k_N)
$$
where $$x = (x, y, d)$$ contains the location information of the pixel $$(x, y)$$ at depth $$d$$. 
The second MLP is used for predicting all global basis functions given the viewing angle. This second MLP is kept separate to ensure that the basis functions are not functions of pixel location and is modeled by:
$$
G_\phi: (v) \rightarrow (H_1,H_2,...,H_N)
$$ where v is the normalized viewing angle.
<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It should be noted that for the first MLP, the first coefficient, $$k_0$$, is not learned but instead stored explicitiy so as to keep a "base color" for each pixel and help retain finer details while also reducing computation cost. Another optimization done is sharing coefficients across multiple planes instead of computing different coefficients for each individual pixel, which results in significant speed gain without compromising visual quality. To optimize the model, the two MLP's are evaluated to generate an output image which is then compared with a ground truth image at the same view.
